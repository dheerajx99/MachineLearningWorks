When people in this organization received what we call “disconfirming feedback,” they would try to move away from the coworkers who had offered it, and they would look for new and different relationships. And the more negative feedback they received, the further the employees would go to forge new networks.

My colleagues—Francesca Gino and Bradley Staats—and I also replicated this result in a lab study where we gave subjects feedback, ostensibly from a partner, on a short story they had written. People who received negative feedback, we found, were far more likely to seek a new partner for their next task than those who received confirming feedback.

HBR: Could you actually map this pattern in the company with the transparent peer reviews?

Yes. If the relationship was discretionary—that is, if people didn’t have to work together—the person who got the negative feedback would usually just disappear from that social network. If the employees had to work together, the recipient of the feedback would look out in the organization for other people to connect with to offset the feedback. They’d form more relationships with people in different departments or other offices. We call this “shopping for confirmation.”
